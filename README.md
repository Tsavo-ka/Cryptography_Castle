Source Code for a simple app dedicated to demonstrating basic Cryptography Principles

This app includes 3 modules + a main file. Each module is dedicated to a specific cryptography principle

1. Ceasar Cipher - The earliest and most basic form of encryption originating in ancient Rome. This module includes a brute-force algorithm to demonstrate the fragility of caesar cipher.
2. Vigen√®re Cipher - A more advanced form of polyalphabetic substitution cipher, originating in Italy in 1553
3. XOR Cipher - An additive cipher from the late 18th - early 19th century

This app is designed to demonstrate cryptography purposes, but also as a python teaching tool to provide students with code analysis challenges and to demonstrate siple coding principles, logic, and structure.

Key learning principles available in this app include:

1. Functions and function interractions
2. Modules and imports
3. Imput validation
4. Logic
5. List Comprehensions
6. Use-Cases of useful string methods (join, split, etc)
7. Code Structure
